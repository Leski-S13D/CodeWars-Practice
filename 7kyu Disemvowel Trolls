Question:
Trolls are attacking your comment section!
A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

Answer1:
一个重要的思维，并不需要真的去剔除每个元素，可以逆向思维，把需要留下来的元素加入新列表
def disemvowel(string_):
    new=[]
    v=['a','e','i','o','u']
    for i in string_:
        if i.lower() not in v:
            new.append(i)
    return ''.join(new)
    
Answer2:
def disemvowel(string):
    return "".join(c for c in string if c.lower() not in "aeiou")
