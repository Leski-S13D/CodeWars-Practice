Question:
Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of following series upto nth term(parameter).
Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 +...
Rules:
You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.
If the given value is 0 then it should return 0.00
You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.
Answer1:
def series_sum(n):
    return '{:.2f}'.format(sum(1.0/(3 * i + 1) for i in range(n)))
    
Answer2:
def series_sum(n):
    if n == 0:
        return '0.00'
    else:
        sum = 0;
        for i in range(n):
            sum += 1 / (1 + i * 3)
        return format(sum, '.2f')
